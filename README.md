# Take-You-To-Corporates

A Solution Made for students of IET DAVV INDORE to provide them a little help for there placements.

College days are never easy for a newbie entering into college, from first MST in the first year to placements in the final year, there are several things he/she 
do for the first time, and in such a situation, if anyone can help them or guide them, the journey becomes very easy.Being in final year student, seating in placement drives 
, we got ample experience and we all felt that if we got to know about company procedure and its experience then interviews would be much smoother. It's not like we haven't
got insight from placement cells, seniors or the internet. But some companies don't have such information due to a lack number of recruitments, college placement cell 
policies, presence of companies in Indore only. So we tried to solve all that problems by implementing a college-level experience-sharing web application. Our web application
<b> "Take you to corporate" </b> is a solution to make college life smoother. Our application is simple yet impactful, we kept all things easy and took all the good features 
of all the alternative applications present in the market and corrected their flaws. The most impactful thing we would work upon is 
<ul>
<li> Limitation of it to our College only - helps in improving accuracy and privacy </li>
<li> Provided framing features for diagrammatic problems. </li>
</ul>

Our application is MERN (MongoDB, Express,React, Node) based application that has the functionality to log in using college mail and share and get all the information
provided, comments section for discussion, search section with company search etc. Our aim for building it is we should learn from other successes as well as what they 
were lacking and also share your insights for others. As a whole, we get helped by our college community and we pay back by helping others.
